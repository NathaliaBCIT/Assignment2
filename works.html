    <p><strong><h3>Creativity has been a lifelong passion, with handwork and crafts as cherished hobbies throughout the years. After realizing my happiest moments involved creating - whether painting, drawing, sewing or designing new patterns - I discovered illustration and surface design. This newfound creative outlet allowed me to seamlessly transition from my 20-year career in architecture and interior design. With a genuine love for colors, shapes, and patterns, I've embraced digital creativity through apps like Procreate. Combining my watercolor skills with design software knowledge, I now create vibrant patterns for apparel, home decor, stationery and more. While building my portfolio and refining my personal style, I continue enhancing my skills through classes and designing new patterns daily. This journey blends my creative passions with professional expertise in a truly rewarding way</h3></strong></p>
